### Introduction

API links allow you to acquire content from other websites and display it wherever you like. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a javaScript joke generator using API links which is an excellent project for novice developers who may want to rapidly make plenty of humorous jokes.

#### Prerequesites

- This article will only be useful if the following is in place before reading it:
  Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript expertise are required for each of the following:

#### Objectives

- By the end of this tutorial learners should be able to:
  1. Design a basic `Html` container to contain content.
  2. Connect API links to get data from other web pages.

### About Example

For the comedy API, we're going to employ HTML, CSS, and javascript as our building blocks. We'll start by adding a header to a box on a webpage. A viewing area and a button will be set up next, which will create our amusing content when pressed.
The following files will be available:

- index.html
- style.css
- app.js

This is the file structure.

### Basic structure of Joke Generator

The `background-color` of our basic box will be `#0C0C0C` and it will be `550px` wide. We'll use `(border-radius:5px)` of `5px` to round the edges of the box. Refer to the following example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Random Joke Generator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- box -->
    <div class="box"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The box will be on the top center position of our page by setting its `position` to `absolute`, on the `left` of our page, we will have `50%` as well as the `top` and lastly, we will `transform` and `translate` our box from the top and left as `-50%`.

```css
.box {
  width: 550px;
  padding: 40px 50px;
  background-color: #0c0c0c;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

The box should resemble the following picture in appearance.

### Adding a title

The next step is to add a title. The title is there to enhance the page's appearance. The title will be oriented center to keep it in the box and will be `24px` in font size. See the example below.

```css
span {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 24px;
  letter-spacing: 1.5px;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

After adding the title, we should have something close to this.

### Set up Joke Viewing Zone

Moving on to the third task where we will create an area of loading all our jokes where this will be made possible by `<p>` tags. There is no need for a specific height and its size will be automatically determined based on the amount of content in it. It will have `opacity` set to `0` to visually hide everything in this section.

```html
<div id="joke-section"></div>
```

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 400;
  text-align: center;
  word-wrap: break-word;
  line-height: 35px;
  margin: 30px 0;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Using `.content-fade` we will set the `opacity` to `1` which essentially means when the class `.content-fade` is effective we should be able to view our content.

```css
.content-fade {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.1s;
}
```

so far we should have the following as displayed below
![output-joke-container](engineering-education/random-joke-generator-a-complete-guide/output-joke-container.png)

### Set up Generate Joke Button

This button will help us generate random jokes when clicked and as a result, we will design it as shown.

```html
<input type="submit" id="btn" value="Generate Jokes" />
```

```css
#btn {
  display: block;
  background-color: #0354ab;
  border: none;
  padding: 5px;
  font-size: 17px;
  color: #ececec;
  padding: 12px 25px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  outline: none;
}
```

Below is the output after adding the button

### Activating The Button

Since we have the required layout, it's time for implementing this example with the help of javaScript.

- First and foremost we have to get the joke container and the `generate joke button` as shown below.

```javascript
// get the joke section container
let jokeSection = document.querySelector("#joke-section");
// get the generate joke button
let generateBtn = document.querySelector("#btn");
```

The next thing we have to do is to include an `API` in our project so that we can be able to fetch content from other websites. Refer to the following snippet.

```javascript
let API =
  "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?blacklistFlags=nsfw,religious,political,racist,sexist,explicit&type=single";
```

Next up we will code a method and name it `acquireJoke`. This method will be ideal since it will help us achieve the following:

- First, we will get rid of class `.content-fade` ensuring that nothing can be viewed with the help of `classList.remove`.
- The data obtained from the `API` using the `fetch` method will be arranged to display with the help of `textContent`.
- We will create a display using paragraph tags and add class `.content-fade` using `classList.add` as a result our text will be seen in the display.

```javascript
// method
function acquireJoke() {
  // remove content-fade class
  jokeSection.classList.remove("content-fade");
  // fetch joke from the API
  fetch(api)
    .then((info) => info.json())
    .then((item) => {
      jokeSection.textContent = `${item.joke}`;
      // add the content-fade class
      jokeSection.classList.add("content-fade");
    });
}
```

The last part is to assign the method we just created so that it fires whenever our button is clicked. The script will contain the code below.

```javascript
generateBtn.addEventListener("click", acquireJoke);
```
