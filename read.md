### Deploying a streamlit app using docker.
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers, after building a machine learning app with streamlit we shall use docker to deploy the app.

In this tutorial, We will first create a simple machine learning model, save it into a pickle file and finally create its interface using streamlit.
Finally after creating the streamlit app we shall use docker to deploy it.

### Prerequisites.
1. A good understanding of python.
2. Good knowledge of machine learning models.

### Getting started
We get started by building a simple machine learning model.
We will build a simple machine learning model to predict the gender of a person based on the inputted by the user.
### Dataset
We will use a dataset of names commonly used by people.
Part of the data is as shown below:

![A Snip of the data ](/data.png)

### installation of the required packages.
We need the following packages
1. [Sckit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
3. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

The following command is used to install the above package.

```bash
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

### Importing panda and numpy.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

### Importing from sckitlearn

```python
import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text
import DictVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction
```
```python
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

```python
df.size
df.dtypes
```

### Checking for missing Values
Ensuring that there are no missing value in our dataset, this provides a well structed data that will optimize on training of our model.
```python
df.isnull().isnull().sum()
```
### Checking for number of male and female
Here we look for the total number of male and  female in our dataset.
```python
df[df.sex == 'F'].size
df[df.sex == 'M'].size
df_names = df
```
### Replacing the data F and M with 0 and 1
This is done so that provide a binary output of either 0 or 1, 0 to reprsent female, 1 to represent male.
```python
df_names.sex.replace({'F':0,'M':1},inplace=True)
Xfeatures =df_names['name']
```
### Feature Extraction
```python
cv = CountVectorizer()
X = cv.fit_transform(Xfeatures)
```
### Processing of model
```python
import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection

```
### Features and labels
After getting our feature and labels to be used by the model for training, we can split our data sets into two sets:
1. Train set
This will be 75% of the data.
2. Test Set
This will be 25% of the data.
```python
X
y = df_names.sex
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25)
```
### Creating the naive bayes classifier model.
We import Naive Bayes Classifier algorothm from the scikit-learn package, the model will now be used to fit and train our model.
```python
import MultinomialNB from sklearn.naive_bayes
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
clf.score(X_test,y_test)
```


### Making Predictions
This function to be used to predict whether the name inputed is for a male or female.
```python
def predict(a):
    test_name = [a]
    vector = cv.transform(test_name).toarray()
    if clf.predict(vector) == 0:
        print("Female")
    else:
        print("Male")
```

### saving the model into a pickle file
We shall save our model using Joblib, by converting our model into a byte stream which will be saved into a pickle file named 'naivemodel.pkl'
```python
import joblib from sklearn.externals
naiveBayesModel = open("model/naivemodel.pkl","wb")
joblib.dump(clf,naiveBayesModel)
naiveBayesModel.close()
```

### Streamlit
Streamlit is a framework that is used by different machine learning engineers and data scientists to build UIs and powerful machine app from the trained model.
These apps can be used for visualization by providing and interactive interfaces to be used by the user.

They provide an easy way to build charts, tables, and different figures according to your application needs, they also utilize the models that have been saved or picked into the app to make a prediction.

### How to install streamlit
Use the following command:
```bash
pip install streamlit

```

### Lets build the streamlit app
1. Create a new Python file named app.py.
2. Then we add our pickled model into a created folder called 'model'.

Our Folder structure should look like this.

```bash
├── app.py
├── model
   ├── naivebayesgendermodel.pkl

```
3. Importing our packages.
```python
import streamlit as st

from sklearn.externals import joblib
import time
from PIL import Image
```
4. Unplicking the model.
This will help to load our model so that it can be used for gender prediction.
Here the byte stream from the 'naivemodel.pkl' file is converted into an object hierachy so that it can now be used by the streamlit app.
```python
gender_nv_model = open("models/naivemodel.pkl","rb")
gender_clf = joblib.load(gender_nv_model)

```
5. Building our prediction logic
```python
def predict_gender(data):
  vect = gender_cv.transform(data).toarray()
  result = gender_clf.predict(vect)
  return result
```
6. Adding styling for the app

We will use material UI for styles and icons.
```python
def load_css(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as f:
        st.markdown('<style>{}</style>'.format(f.read()), unsafe_allow_html=True)

def load_icon(icon_name):
    st.markdown('<i class="material-icons">{}</i>'.format(icon_name), unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

7. Adding Image
```python
def load_images(file_name):
  img = Image.open(file_name)
  return st.image(img,width=300)
```
Your File structure should be as shown:
```bash
├── male.png
├── female.png
├── model
   ├── nainvemodel.pkl

```
### Designing the user interface
This is where we use streamlit different tools and code syntaxt to design a nice UI

```python
def main():
  """Gender Classifier App
    With Streamlit

  """

  st.title("Gender Classifier")
  html_temp = """
  <div style="background-color:blue;padding:10px">
  <h2 style="color:grey;text-align:center;">Streamlit App </h2>
  </div>

  """
  st.markdown(html_temp,unsafe_allow_html=True)
  load_css('icon.css')
  load_icon('people')

  name = st.text_input("Enter Name","Pleas Type Here")
  if st.button("Predict"):
    result = predict_gender([name])
    if result[0] == 0:
      prediction = 'Female'
      img = 'female.png'
    else:
      result[0] == 1
      prediction = 'Male'
      img = 'male.png'

    st.success('Name: {} was classified as {}'.format(name.title(),prediction))
    load_images(img)
```

In the above code we are using streamlit to design how our user interface will look like as follows:
- Adding the apps title.
- Styling our app by adding the app's background color, text color and the general structure of our app.
- Adding a text input area where a user can key in a name to be predicted as either male or female.
- Addding a button that a user can use to submit the input.
So will set our app with the different styles:
- Backgrond-color: blue
- Text color: grey,
- Padding: 10px,
- App Title: Gender Classifier App

Finally we can run our app using the following command.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Our userinterface will be as shown below.

1. A prediction where the output is male.

![Male Prediction](/male-prediction.png)

2. Prediction where the output is female

![Female Prediction](/female-prediction.png)


### Dockerizing the streamlit app
1. Lets create a docker file
 In the working root directory lets create a file and lets name it 'Dockerfile' without any extensions.

Your File structure should be as shown.
```bash
├── Dockerfile
├── male.png
├── female.png
├── model
   ├── nainvemodel.pkl

```

2. Docker Layers
- Firstly we define our base image where we want to build our file from as show below
```docker
FROM python:3.7
```
Here we will use the official python imge from docker.
- Create a working directory as shown
```docker
WORKDIR /app
```
- Copy all the requirements into the new directory created
```docker
COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
```
Copying from the source to the destination.

- Install all that is the requirments.txt file
```docker
RUN pip install -r requiremts.txt
```
- Expose the port to be used to run the application
```docker
EXPOSE 8501
```
This is the same port that our streamlit app was running on.
- Copy our app from the current directory to the working area
```docker
COPY ./app
```
- Create an entry point to make our image executable
```docker
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run"]

CMD ["app.py"]
```

3. Building Docker Image
We build using the following command then "." to run the current directory.
```docker
docker build -t streamlitapp:latest .
```
Also you can use the following command to specify the file.
```docker
docker build -t streamlitapp:latest .f Dockerfile
```
The Output will be a shown below

```bash

```
- To view all of you images use the following command.
```docker
docker image ls
```
- output is as shown
```bash
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
streamlitapp                 latest             73dv092ecsee7        2 minutes ago       1.24GB
testapp                      latest             d660b1f1t3e         1 weeks ago          794MB
```
4. Creating a container
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlitapp:latest
```
Result:
```bash
dv092e0ff6btdte593a3cad9e50ef01f1t3e89fe41816624edted7fb1f1tfd1f
```
It also start our streamlit app in the following urls:

1. Network URL: http://172.17.0.2.8501

2. External URL: https://193.106.63.249:8501

Therefore the streamlit app is now deployed with docker.
